0.15  -- 2009-10-19

      using named Unicode properties instead of POSIX character classes
      within any context dependent transliteration rule.
      The following transliteration tables are affected:
        * xml/din_1460_bul.xml
        * xml/iso_9.xml
        * xml/streamlined_system_bul.xml

    * Updated indent of all transliteration tables.

0.14  -- 2009-10-16

0.10 -- 2008-04-17

    * lib/Lingua/Translit.pm, xml/translit.dtd: Contexts can now contain two
      patterns at a time (before and after). These are combined using AND
      logics and therefore act as a logical "inbetween".
    * xml/xml2dump.pl: Switched from XML::Simple to XML::LibXML in order to
      prevent loss of whitespace charactes like U+180E.
    * xml/greeklish.xml: GREEK CAPITAL LETTER UPSILON WITH DIALYTIKA (U+03AB)
      bug fixed.
    * t/13_tr_Greeklish.t: Added test for upsilon bugfix.

      translit_list_supported()
    * translit: Display Lingua::Translit's version if show_list() is called

      is substituted by a blank.
    * Makefile.PL: Exit with a hint on MSWin32 rather than dying in
      t/03_translit.t
    * xml/xml2dump.pl: workaround for discarded U+180E character (see l.85)
